# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction
Currently rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. The purpose of this movement is to modernize cities and encourage people to head to a green world. Let's take the examples of Paris in 2007, where "velibs" were introduced and Amsterdam, where there are more bikes than cars. The goal is to facilitate the commute in the Seoul and reduce the amount of cars and the pollution. Indeed, the development of the way to commute reduced the use of cars to go to work and visit the city.
